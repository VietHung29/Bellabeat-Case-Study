## Recommendations
How can these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

We can make marketing recommendations based on what we have learned about how customers are currently using smart fitness devices:

1. Very few customers utilized the weight log feature, so this does not appear to be a selling point. Focus on marketing other features such as activity, sleep, and steps tracking, and consider further research into how to make the weight log feature more marketable

2. Our data shows that when active, participants engaged the most in "light" activity and did not have many "very active" minutes each day. The company could add a "level up" feature in which participants can earn points based on time spent being active, with higher levels of activity earning more points. This could motivate users to engage in active minutes more often.

3. There's about a 1000 step decrease on Sundays compared to the other days of the week. A notification on Sunday mornings with a goal to hit a certain number of steps, along with a reward for hitting a 7-day streak could help close this gap and encourage customers to use the device all days of the week.

4. Based on data showing the most usage around 6pm, it seems likely most users have typical work hours during the day and get most of their steps in after work. An ad targeted towards working adults focused on easily tracking steps throughout their busy days could be effective. A reminder notification around 12pm and 8pm can encourage users to increase their activity levels during other break times such as lunch and after dinner as well. 

5. On average, participants got less than the CDC recommended 7 hours of sleep per night. Continue marketing the device's sleep tracking feature as participants who are not getting enough sleep may want a way to track their sleep patterns. Consider marketing along with a meditation app or habit tracker.
